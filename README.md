# Dom's Nexus
Dom's Nexus is a data pack library and framework designed to make Minecraft mapmaking easier and more streamlined, and to introduce various functions to allow for very sophisticated mechanics.

Attached are four packs, the main Dom's Nexus data pack, the External Time Measurer data pack, the Template Module data pack, and the Template Module resource pack, each serving its own purpose.
The Dom's Nexus data pack is the core of it all, hence the name. It contains various elaborate functions which are used by the modules which hook into it.
The purpose of the External Time Measurer is to make the lag manager compatible with data packs that are not hooked into the Nexus. It works by having the Nexus be first enabled at the External Time Measurer be last enabled.
Lastly the Template Module implements various random mechanics for the purposes of showcasing how to use the Nexus. The current version implements four entities and one object. The four entities are a skull mob, a physics-based soccer ball, a car, and the spider brain. The one object is a basic sphere generator. The attached resource pack contains the relevant assets used by the module.

# Terms of Use
The rules are pretty simple.
Firstly, anything you do with any of these packs including modification or distribution, credit me and link back to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/Dominexis
Secondly, you may modify and redistribute the Template Module all you like, its purpose is to show how to use the Nexus so being modifiable falls in-line with that purpose.
Lastly, for the Nexus itself, two use cases exist: usage alongside data packs in an arbitrary world, and usage in a map or a server.
For usage alongside other data packs, do not modify or distribute the Nexus. This is because all modules loaded into a world expect the Nexus to have all the builtin features, so if you use a modified version of it for your module, another module may break. This must be avoided. Link to this repository to let your users know that it requires the Nexus to function. The version verification system will throw an error if the Nexus is not loaded and will link them to the post on Planet Minecraft.
For usage in a map or on a server where you control every data pack, you are allowed to modify the Nexus to suit your needs, whether that'd be to remove features you aren't using to save space, bypass certain restrictions, or specializing a set of functions for your particular use case. The Nexus may be included in your map and distributed alongside it, but if the Nexus is modified, do not publicly distribute the modified Nexus outside of the map as that could cause the aforementioned compatibility issues if someone tries to use it for their own projects. When used in a map or a server, credit me and link back to my YouTube channel in the map or server in a way that is not obscure but will be noticed.

# Beta Release
Currently Dom's Nexus is under an open beta, meaning that the feature list is incomplete, but I am releasing it to the world to stress test it before the official release. I am looking for people to point out flaws or bugs as well as suggestions for how to make it better and more intuitive.
