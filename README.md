# Dom-s-Nexus
Dom's Nexus is a data pack library and framework designed to make Minecraft mapmaking easier and more streamlined, and to introduce various functions to allow for very sophisticated mechanics.

Attached are four packs, the main Dom's Nexus data pack, the External Time Measurer data pack, the Template Module data pack, and the Template Module resource pack, each serving its own purpose.

The Dom's Nexus data pack is the core of it all, hence the name. It contains various elaborate functions which are used by the modules which hook into it.

The purpose of the External Time Measurer is to make the lag manager compatible with data packs that are not hooked into the Nexus. It works by having the Nexus be first enabled at the External Time Measurer be last enabled.

Lastly the Template Module implements various random mechanics for the purposes of showcasing how to use the Nexus. The current version implements 4 entities and 1 object. The 4 entities are a skull mob, a physics-based soccer ball, a car, and the spider brain. The 1 object is a basic sphere generator. The attached resource pack contains the relevant assets used by the module.

# Terms of Use
The rules are pretty simple.
Firstly, anything you do with any of these packs including modification or distribution, credit me and link back to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/Dominexis
Secondly, you may modify and redistribute the Template Module all you like, its purpose is to show how to use the Nexus so being modifiable falls in-line with that purpose.
Lastly, the Nexus is intended to be a self-contained unit, do not tamper with it, do not modify it or redistribute it. If you want to suggest a change or an update, do so on my Discord server: https://discord.gg/AV8N6zP But do not take it upon yourself to update the Nexus. If you make a module for the Nexus, link to this repository for standalone data packs, or if you wish to apply it to a map in which the Nexus must be included, get my explicit permission.

# Beta Release
Currently Dom's Nexus is under an open beta, meaning that the feature list is incomplete, but I am releasing it to the world to stress test it before the official release. I am looking for people to point out flaws or bugs as well as suggestions for how to make it better and more intuitive.
